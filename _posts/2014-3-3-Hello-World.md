# Factor Strings
(Gradual release of responsibility)

## Focused Instruction

### Establishing purpose
##### Learning purpose

* Understand the concepts of factor, multiple, prime
* Understand numbers in terms of relations to other numbers

#### Success criteria

* I can identify the factors of a number.
* I can express a number as the product of primes.
* I can identify prime numbers

#### Language purpose
* Factor,
* Multiple, Product
* Prime, Composite
* Multiplicative identity

#### Social purpose
* Exploring
* Organising data
* Knowing when we have finished
* Mathematical wondering

### Modelling or demonstrating
Display the chart on the screen.

### Thinking aloud
* What do I notice about this chart?
* There’s a line connecting 15 and 32.
* There’s a line connecting 5, 2, 16 and 3.
* I wonder what they have in common?

* (Try adding them…
* Try multiplying…?

* Ah! They both have a product of 480!

* I wonder if I can find any other strings with a product of 480.

## Guided Instruction

> Teacher: answering questions, prompts, cues and direct explanations
> Conducted in small, purposeful, groups. 
> Ideal time for differentiated engagement between teacher and student.
> Use “Enabling prompts” from “Participating in the Inquiry” here:

## Collaborative Learning

> (Meaningful collaborative group work)

Students to work in groups of 3 finding factor strings.

Once all groups have found at least two strings, begin asking students to record ones found on the whiteboard.

#### Thinking aloud
* When this gets messy and hard to find, pause the class.
* Discuss how we can structure our data better: 
  * perhaps by length, and ascending order of factor.
* Model good mathematical thinking with “I wonder…” statements:
* I wonder what the shortest string is?
* I wonder what the longest string is?
  * How will we know?
* I wonder how many strings there are?

## Independent Learning

> (Teacher’s role: feedback)

Students move on to individual work.
Students can be extended with the prompts:
* What are all the factor pairs for 480? What are all the factors strings that have 3 factors? How do you know you have found them all? What about factor strings that are 4, 5 or 6 numbers long?

### Parallel tasks
Option | Task
 :---:  | :--- 
Option 1: | You factor a number into primes. There are two different prime factors. What else do you know about the number?
Option 2: | You factor a number into primes. There are two prime factors, but one is repeated. What else do you know about the number?”
Option 3: | You find all the factors of a number.  There are an odd number of factors.  What else do you know about the number?

Follow-up questions such as these would be appropriate:
* Could the number be prime? How do you know?
* Does the number have more than three factors? How do you know?
* How many factors does it have?
* How could you use a diagram to show that?”

(Excerpt from *More Good Questions* Marian Small and Amy Lin)

or

### Open Question
You multiply a number by another number that is 3 more than your first number. 
* What are some products you can get? 
* What are some products you cannot get? 
* Do you think you can get 100?”

(Excerpt from
Good Questions
Marian Small)



### Wrap up
* When we have found the longest string, how do we know?
* What's true about these factors.

* Introduce the idea of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic (in appropriate language):

> Any positive integer can be uniquely expressed as the product of primes.

#### Consolidation
Create Frayer Models of the vocabulary.
